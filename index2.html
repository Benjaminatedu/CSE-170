Class: CSE 170

1. My Style: I am easygoing and personable with very few reservations when it comes to my working material. I like to keep to myself as this is where I get the most work done, but that doesn’t stop me from cooperating well with others. I firmly believe that any experience is good experience and will try to excel with any given task. I am a pushover when it comes to helping other people, to the point that I will sacrifice the quality of my own work to help a peer or colleague.

2. When I like people to approach me: I like people to approach me when I am doing something wrong and need to be corrected, when they want to tell me I’m doing well and when somebody needs help. If the person approaching is respectful and polite, I will accept their criticism with no reservations. If the individual is rude or impolite, I am not very likely to listen to what they are saying.

3. What I value: I value privacy, comfortability, and a learning atmosphere above all else. I would like to be in an environment where I am able to constantly pick up new skills to help round out my capabilities.

4. How to best communicate with me: I prefer people communicate to me face to face (in person or virtually) as this is the best way for me to learn what I need to. In this atmosphere I am able to ask as many clarifying questions as I need to. If I don’t ask these small questions, I will often get overwhelmed at first, and will not make much progress as until I am comfortable with the material, I am not likely to get much work done.

5. How I make decisions: I make decisions based of what I find to be most rational and helpful to everybody. I prefer to be objective and unbiased when it comes to important decisions. If there is a situation where I will be negatively affected by a decision, but it is the best option to be made, I will not hesitate to accept it.

6. How to help me: I believe the best way for people to help me is to be honest about my shortcomings and offer plenty of learning and reference materials. I learn best from first talking to people who know more than me, then spending time afterwards looking into reference material to fill the rest of the gaps in my knowledge. Having an area or space where I can experiment also will help me quite a lot.

7. What I don’t have patience for: I will not tolerate selfishness, pettiness, rudeness, or unneeded drama. When individuals are rude, I lose patience very quickly and will usually remove myself from the situation or shut down entirely.

8. What people misunderstand about me: Due to my introverted and quiet nature, people often assume I don’t like to be approached or asked for help. The opposite is quite true. Due to my quiet nature I have a hard time asking if others need help, but I love being of service to my peers and will gladly sacrifice my own time to help them.
