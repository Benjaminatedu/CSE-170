Reflection Week 02
Benjamin Bell									Total Points 100

•	Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?

This weeks topic is important because in order for a team to function, they need to know how to coordinate, cooperate, and communicate. Each of these actions are impossible without the other.

•	How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?

I plan on contributing to my team by helping them understand github when I can, and also by asking pertinent questions that will help us receive pertinent answers

•	How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?

My experience this week is similar to other weeks due to the fact that github can be confusing to work with, but also very important.

•	How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?

My experience is most likely similar to my classmates experience as we are all in the same class. Some have more experience, but most have an equivalent experience to mine.

•	Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before?

I helped my classmate properly create his github repository. They learned how to at least start and add files to github.

I believe that I earned a 100 this week due to my diligence in learning the material and helping my classmates when they were confused.
