Reflection Week 02
Benjamin Bell									Total Points 100

<p> •	Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?

This weeks topic is important because in order for a team to function, they need to understand how they influence and are influenced by the people and environments around them.
</p>
•	How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?

I plan on contributing to my team by making sure that I am a positive influence on them, as well as not being so influential as to be overbearing or commanding.

<p>•	How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?

My experience this week is a little different from previous weeks, because this lesson showed me that I can be a very powerful force for either order or confusion.
</p>
•	How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?

My experience is most likely similar to my classmates experience as we are all in the same class. Some have more experience, but most have an equivalent experience to mine.

<p>•	Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before?

I helped my classmate understand the different types of influences, as well as how to complete the fox/geese game we played on the second day.
</p>
I believe that I earned a 100 this week due to my diligence in learning the material and helping my classmates when we were working together
